        Classes define the path your character takes, offering options such as paladin, warrior, mage, rogue, monk, druid, and many more.
        Each class comes with its own special abilities and play style, allowing you to craft characters that fit your preferred storytelling or gameplay approach.
        Additionally, you can select from a wide variety of races, from humans and elves to dwarves and exotic creatures, each adding distinct traits, cultures,
        and lore to your character. Every decision you make helps shape personality, motivations, and narrative, ensuring that no two creations are ever alike.
        Every choice you make unlocks brand new possibilities, helping your character grow, evolve, and shine in any adventure.
